# PUTRA T
A real-time on-campus bus tracking app

# Introduction

Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) has been offering shuttle bus services for their students to move around campus.
However, the lack of information on the bus's estimated time of arrivals, current occupancy, and location has resulted in low ridership and inconvenience for commuters.
Real-time monitoring systems using GPS and internet connection have been shown to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of shuttle bus services.
These systems provide students with information on the bus's location and estimated arrival time, improving ridership and commuter satisfaction.
